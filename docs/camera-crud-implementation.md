# Camera Management CRUD Implementation

## Current Status

We have implemented a simplified version of the Camera Management page that displays a basic table of cameras with mock data. The current implementation focuses on rendering the list of cameras with their details and visual status indicators, but without interactive functionality.

## Implementation Issues and Solutions

During the implementation process, we encountered several issues:

1. **Clone Issues with `use_state`**: The Yew framework's `use_state` hooks were causing compilation errors when attempting to clone them for use in callbacks. This is a common issue with Rust's strong type system and Yew's state management.

2. **Solution**: We simplified the implementation to avoid complex state management. The current implementation uses a static function to generate mock data and renders it directly without state management.

## Next Steps

To complete the Camera Management CRUD functionality, we need to:

1. Implement Modal Component: Add a reusable modal component that can be used for adding, editing, viewing, and deleting cameras.
   
2. Add State Management: Carefully implement state management for:
   - Modal visibility
   - Form input values
   - Selected camera data for edit/view/delete operations
   
3. Form Validation: Implement validation for camera input fields (IP address format, required fields).

4. API Integration: When the backend is ready, connect the frontend to the appropriate API endpoints.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Static UI (Completed)
- ✅ Create basic table display of cameras
- ✅ Implement static mock data
- ✅ Add visual indicators for camera status

### Phase 2: Interactive Modals
- Add a modal for creating new cameras
- Implement camera editing functionality
- Create a view modal for detailed camera information
- Add deletion confirmation modal

### Phase 3: State Management
- Implement proper state management for modals
- Add form validation
- Ensure proper state updates with Yew's hooks

### Phase 4: API Integration
- Connect to backend API endpoints
- Handle loading, success, and error states
- Implement proper error messaging

## Mock Data Implementation

For development purposes, we've implemented a `mock_cameras()` function that returns a vector of camera objects with sample data. This allows us to develop and test the UI without requiring the backend API to be fully implemented.

## Working with Yew's State Management

When working with Yew's state management, we need to be careful with cloning state hooks. The proper pattern is:

```rust
let some_state = use_state(|| initial_value);

// For callbacks:
let cloned_state = some_state.clone();
let callback = Callback::from(move |_| {
    // Use cloned_state.set() to update state
});
```

This pattern needs to be carefully followed to avoid the compilation errors we encountered.

## Future Considerations

- Real-time updates: Consider implementing WebSocket connections for real-time camera status updates.
- Pagination: For larger systems with many cameras, implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
- Filtering/Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort the camera list by different attributes.
- Snapshot Preview: Add functionality to show a snapshot from the camera when hovering over a camera item.

## Available API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for camera operations:

- `GET /api/cameras` - Get all cameras
- `GET /api/cameras/{id}` - Get a specific camera by ID
- `POST /api/cameras` - Create a new camera
- `PUT /api/cameras/{id}` - Update an existing camera
- `DELETE /api/cameras/{id}` - Delete a camera

## Camera Data Model

```rust
pub struct Camera {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub ip_address: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub location: String,
    pub active: bool,
    pub status: CameraStatus,
    pub last_update: String,
}

pub enum CameraStatus {
    Online,
    Offline,
    Maintenance,
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. [✅] **Create basic Camera page with table view**
   - Implement a simple table to display camera information
   - Show camera status with appropriate styling

2. [ ] **Create Modal Component for Adding/Editing Cameras**
   - Implement a form with fields for all camera properties
   - Add validation for required fields and IP address format
   - Include status selection dropdown

3. [ ] **Implement Add Camera Functionality**
   - Add a button to open the add camera modal
   - Handle form submission to create a new camera
   - Refresh the camera list after successful creation

4. [ ] **Implement Edit Camera Functionality**
   - Add edit buttons to each camera row
   - Pre-populate the modal form with existing camera data
   - Handle form submission to update the camera
   - Refresh the camera list after successful update

5. [ ] **Implement View Camera Details**
   - Add view buttons to each camera row
   - Display read-only camera details in a modal
   - Include camera status history and statistics (if available)

6. [ ] **Implement Delete Camera Functionality**
   - Add delete buttons to each camera row
   - Show a confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Handle deletion and refresh the camera list

7. [ ] **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for all API calls
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms for network failures

8. [ ] **Loading States**
   - Show loading indicators during API operations
   - Disable form submission buttons during processing

## Next Steps

1. Add the modal component with proper state management
2. Implement the Camera form component with validation
3. Connect the Add Camera functionality with the modal and form
4. Add the view/edit/delete functionality one by one

## Mock Implementation

For development and testing purposes, we'll implement these features using mock data from the `mock_cameras()` function before connecting to the real API.

## Future Enhancements

- Camera grouping feature
- Batch actions for multiple cameras
- Camera discovery functionality
- Real-time status updates
- Camera preview/snapshot functionality
