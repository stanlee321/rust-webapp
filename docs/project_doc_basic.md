Below is the full, final document incorporating all previous details plus an added section for a navigation drawer.

1. Overview

Purpose:
Develop an administrator web application for managing IP cameras and monitoring their data. The system enables IT administrators to configure, monitor, and report on camera activity using a clean, minimalist interface inspired by Material Design principles.

Target Users:
IT administrators responsible for maintaining networked IP cameras.

Functional Requirements:
	‚Ä¢	IP Camera CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete camera configurations.
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Data Monitoring: Display live camera statuses and streams.
	‚Ä¢	Role-Based Access Control: Enforce permissions so that only authorized users (admins) can access or modify certain screens and actions.
	‚Ä¢	Report Generation: Generate activity logs, uptime summaries, and other analytical reports.
	‚Ä¢	Settings Management: Manage system settings such as server connectivity, license information, and user preferences.
	‚Ä¢	User Registration Info: Display the name of the person who registered the product within the Settings page.

2. Technology Stack

Frontend
	‚Ä¢	Yew (Rust): A component-based framework compiled to WebAssembly for a high-performance UI.
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that supports rapid styling and a Material Design‚Äìinspired aesthetic.
	‚Ä¢	Material Design Principles: Used for defining spacing, typography, interactive states, and component layout.

Backend
	‚Ä¢	Rust with Tokio: Asynchronous runtime for high-performance server-side operations.
	‚Ä¢	Serde: JSON serialization/deserialization for API communication.
	‚Ä¢	REST API Endpoints: Endpoints for camera management, user authentication, reports, and settings.

Security
	‚Ä¢	External Authentication API: Manages user credentials and returns tokens (e.g., JWT) that include role information.
	‚Ä¢	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enforced in both the frontend (by hiding/disabling UI elements) and backend (through API access control).

3. Screens & Components

5. UI/UX Guidelines & Alignment

The overall design adheres to Material Design principles and a minimalist approach.

Color Palette
	‚Ä¢	Primary Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Use a primary blue or teal for headers, buttons, and active states.
	‚Ä¢	Accent Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Use green for ‚Äúonline‚Äù statuses and red/orange for errors or offline states.
	‚Ä¢	Background Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Light neutrals (white or light gray) to ensure content clarity.
	‚Ä¢	Text Colors:
	‚Ä¢	Dark, high-contrast text (near-black) on light backgrounds.

Borders & Shadows
	‚Ä¢	Borders:
	‚Ä¢	Minimal use; 1px solid borders in subtle gray for section delineation.
	‚Ä¢	Rounded Corners:
	‚Ä¢	Components such as cards, buttons, and modals use a border-radius of 4‚Äì8px.
	‚Ä¢	Shadows:
	‚Ä¢	Apply subtle box-shadows (e.g., box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) for elevation effects on modals and cards.

Typography & Icons
	‚Ä¢	Typography:
	‚Ä¢	Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto) with hierarchy indicated by different font weights.
	‚Ä¢	Icons:
	‚Ä¢	Employ Material icons for consistency; standard sizes are 24px‚Äì32px with appropriate padding.

Spacing & Grid
	‚Ä¢	Grid System:
	‚Ä¢	Follow an 8dp grid system to maintain consistent spacing.
	‚Ä¢	Padding/Margins:
	‚Ä¢	Consistent and generous spacing to avoid clutter.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive States:
	‚Ä¢	Clear focus and hover states (ripple effects, color changes) per Material Design standards.

Global Alignment
	‚Ä¢	Responsive Design:
	‚Ä¢	Header and drawer collapse gracefully on smaller screens (using a hamburger menu for the drawer).
	‚Ä¢	Footer remains unobtrusive and fixed at the bottom.
	‚Ä¢	Consistency:
	‚Ä¢	All UI components adhere to a unified style guide, ensuring a seamless user experience.

6. Development Guidelines

Component Architecture (with Modals, Notifications & Drawer)
	‚Ä¢	Reusable Components:
	‚Ä¢	Modal Component: For confirmations, form popups, and error alerts.
	‚Ä¢	Notification Component: To handle real-time notifications accessible via the header‚Äôs bell icon.
	‚Ä¢	Header, Navigation Drawer & Footer Components: Maintain global layout consistency.
	‚Ä¢	State Management:
	‚Ä¢	Global state includes user session details, notifications, and theme preferences.
	‚Ä¢	Routing & Access Control:
	‚Ä¢	Protect routes using role-based checks on both the client and server sides.

API Integration & Mock Data
	‚Ä¢	API Endpoints:
	‚Ä¢	Document endpoints such as /api/cameras, /api/login, /api/settings, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Mock Data:
	‚Ä¢	Use mock data structures during development to simulate API responses.
	‚Ä¢	Error Handling:
	‚Ä¢	Implement popups and toast notifications for API errors and user feedback.

Code Organization & Documentation
	‚Ä¢	Modular Structure:
	‚Ä¢	Separate components into modules: components, services (API calls), models (data structures), and routes.
	‚Ä¢	Version Control & CI:
	‚Ä¢	Use Git with clear commit messages and integrate continuous testing (for frontend WASM builds and Rust backend tests).
	‚Ä¢	Style Guides:
	‚Ä¢	Maintain inline documentation and a project README that details setup, build processes, and UI/UX design decisions.

7. Final Notes

This comprehensive document serves as a complete reference for developers and designers working on the administrator web app. It details the system architecture, UI components (with ASCII mockups for Login, Dashboard, Camera Management, Settings, Live View, Reports, Header, Navigation Drawer, and Footer), and UI/UX guidelines (color, typography, spacing, borders, and interactive states). By following these guidelines, the team can ensure a consistent, secure, and user-friendly product that adheres to modern design standards and Material Design principles.

With this final document, development of both the frontend (Yew + Tailwind CSS) and backend (Rust with Tokio & Serde) can commence, providing clear guidance on implementation and design alignment.
