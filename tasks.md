# IP Camera Administrator Web Application - Task List

## Project Overview

This project is an IP Camera Administrator Web Application built with:
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum
- **Frontend**: Rust/Yew with WebAssembly
- **Authentication**: JWT-based

> Current Progress: 
> - Basic project structure is set up
> - Simple API endpoints exist
> - Mock data services implemented for all entity types (users, cameras, logs, reports, settings)
> - CRUD API endpoints created for all entity types
> - Basic authentication endpoint and login screen with validation
> - UI layout with navigation drawer and global components implemented
> - Data tables for displaying entities

### Camera Management Implementation Notes

The Camera Management page has been initially implemented with a simplified approach to avoid state management issues with Yew's `use_state` hooks. The current implementation:

1. Displays a basic table of cameras with mock data
2. Shows camera information (name, IP address, location, status, last update)
3. Has placeholder buttons for View, Edit, and Delete operations

Next steps:
1. Add interactive modal functionality for adding cameras
2. Implement edit and delete operations
3. Refine the UI/UX for better user experience
4. Connect to backend API when ready

For a more detailed explanation, see the `docs/camera-crud-implementation.md` document.
